ðŸš€ Data Engineering Interview Day Cheat Sheet
Ingestion & Bronze

Validate files â†’ presence, size, schema, corruption.

Good â†’ Bronze table, Bad â†’ Quarantine.

Metadata: ingestion_time, source_file.

Idempotency: file hash + MERGE.

Scale: Databricks Auto Loader.

Incremental Processing (Silver)

Dedup â†’ window on id, updated_at.

MERGE with condition s.updated_at > t.updated_at.

Late data â†’ watermark/SLA cutoff.

Partition by event_date.

CDC Upserts (Delta)

Delta MERGE: I/U/D.

Deletes â†’ whenMatchedDelete(op='D').

Audit table â†’ id, op, updated_at, processed_at.

MERGE = idempotent, safe to re-run.

Joins & Skew

Broadcast small table (dim).

Salting for skew keys.

Separate heavy key path.

Spark 3 AQE auto handles skew.

Data Modeling (Gold / DWH)

Star schema: facts (txn) + dims (cust, product).

SCD Type 1 = overwrite, Type 2 = new row with validity.

Surrogate keys for stable joins.

Partition facts by date, ZORDER for queries.

Data Quality

Nulls, ranges, uniqueness, FK integrity.

Tools: Great Expectations, DLT expectations.

Streaming â†’ checks in foreachBatch.

Bad rows â†’ quarantine â†’ reprocess.

SQL Optimization

Diagnose: EXPLAIN, Spark UI.

Partition low-card cols (date), ZORDER high-card (cust_id).

Column pruning, broadcast joins.

Compact files (~128MB).

Pre-aggregate for dashboards.

Orchestration (Airflow)

DAG: Bronze â†’ Silver â†’ Gold.

max_active_runs=1, retries=2â€“3, SLA alerts.

Backfill via run_date param.

Observability: row counts, lineage.

DAG Reliability

Retries: exponential backoff.

Idempotent tasks (MERGE, unique IDs).

Sensors: reschedule mode.

Timeout tasks to avoid zombies.

SLA alerts for late jobs.

Security & Governance

IAM, Unity Catalog, least privilege.

Encryption: at rest + in transit.

PII: mask/hash/tokenize.

Row-level = filter rows, column-level = mask cols.

GDPR deletes â†’ propagate via CDC MERGE.

Debugging

Spark UI: stragglers = skew.

OOM â†’ repartition, filter early, increase executor mem.

Skew â†’ salting, broadcast, AQE.

Small files â†’ OPTIMIZE/compaction.

Streaming checkpoint corruption â†’ reset + replay.

âœ… Thatâ€™s the 30-bullet high-compression story.
If you can recall this flow + tell it as a story (Bronze â†’ Silver â†’ Gold â†’ Orchestration â†’ Security â†’ Debugging), youâ€™ll ace most DE interviews.
